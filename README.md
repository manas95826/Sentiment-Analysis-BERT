A sentiment analysis tool that utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to analyze the sentiment of text inputs. The tool determines whether the input text conveys a positive or negative sentiment and provides a confidence score to quantify the sentiment prediction.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis using pre-trained transformer models.
- Outputs sentiment label (positive/negative) and confidence score.
- User-friendly interface created using Gradio for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

# 1. Clone this repository:
